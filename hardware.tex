\section{Robotic Hardware}
\label{sec:robots}



Marine robotic platforms are increasingly cost-effective, can stay 'on
station' for periods of sustained time, and can do so in unseasonably
harsh conditions, in comparison to manned platforms. Their cost and
high-resolution data gathering capabilities implies that a number of
these assets could be deployed simultaneously for targeted missions
for dual-use. To do so, requires a judicious mix of assets with
different capabilities and operating conditions leading to information
derived from multiple sources with different levels of synopticity to
provide situational awareness to either an oceanographer or a
warfighter.
