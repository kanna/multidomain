\section{The Oceanographic Context}
\label{sec:context}

The vastness of the ocean and the lack of sustained human presence in
most of its surface, cuopled with the harshness of the environment
whether it be the open ocean or coastal zones, mandates the use of
multiple sensing and perception modalities. Using multiple platforms
allows for observing larger spatial contexts; if these platforms could
be sustained then both spatio-temporal measurements can then aid in
bio-geophysical process studies of the upper ocean as well as in
security focused needs. However, the cost imposed by manned platforms
is prohibitive\footnote{Typical day costs of a research vessel amount
  to about \$22,000.}, and sustained human presence on such vessels is
unrealistic in both human and financial costs. Satellite remote
sensing using a train of spacecraft is a possibility, even if image
resolution is often distorted by atmospheric effects, and the lack of
pentration of active optical or radar based measurements beyond a
meter of the upper water column. 

Unmanned platforms, such as UAVs, ASVs, and AUVs are a viable
alternative which cost-permitting can be deployed across a large area
simultaneously while making measurements across space and time. For
oceanographic measurements, the meso-scale ($\sim 50$ Km$^2$) is
considered a viable spatial region of study and could also be
considered a starting point for observing and monitoring a region for
security. For instance, frontal zones, where two disparate bodies of
water come together to form a surface expression, are important
biological phenomenon of study. Typically, they can occur at a range
of spatial scales, from several hundred meters up to many thousand
kilometers \cite{belkin2007fronts} and are a feature which can
catalyze the generation of mesoscale ($\sim 100$ Km) meanders,
‘eddies’ and rings, and sub-mesoscale ($\sim 10$ Km) 'filaments' other
smaller structures all of which have substantial impact on ocean
variability and bio-geochemistry. Exploration of such dynamic features
with a single platform will unlikely provide an understanding of its
variability over space and time, while multiple robotic platforms, can
provide not only measurements spread spatially, but an understanding
of their temporal variability \cite{pinto20,pinto22}.

Spatial resolution of data is another principal challenge in ocean
observation. Typically, measurements made using manned vessels involving
repeated stop-and-go of the research vessel, to deploy sensors and
obtain samples with a winch, then moving the ship to the next station
after recovering the sensors only to repeat the process. Doing so over
large spatial scales essentially ``smears'' the time across these
measurements so aliasing \cite{} in this manner removes the correlation
between one measurement with another, unless they're made in some
proximity. The nature and environmental conditions contribute to how
correlated such measurements could be (or not) and as a result; these
are a manifestation of such oceanographic point-measurements across
large spatial and temporal scales. Conversely, untethered robotic
vehicles while moving slowly through the water column, are making
continuous measurements in high-resolution. As a result the principal
challenge is ensuring there is adequate onboard energy available for
operations in the order of a few days, depending on the power
source. Most platforms carry batteries as their primary source; recent
ASV's commercially available however leverage wind, solar or wave energy
(or a mixture of these) and as a result can sustain themselves far
longer and have proven themselves in the harshest of conditions, for
data gathering and observation. Unpowered AUV's or gliders are even more
effective in this context, since they leverage their kinetic energy of
movement through the water column, combined with a ballasting process
with a buoyancy engine to change their potential energy, resulting in
months-long missions collecting data in a saw-tooth (or a 'Yo-Yo')
pattern.
